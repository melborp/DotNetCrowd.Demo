
#Welcome to Demo code project for DotNetCrowd event in Vilnius (2016-03-31)

###This demo code was presented during Visual Studio Team Services Extensions session.
The assignment was to add a capability, which would allow automatic generation of Task based on description in a specific format in a PBI.
It was also important to only add those tasks, that didnt exist yet. For simplicity, only title is supported by the format.

Format: Task "title" 

### This demo uses the following technologies:

- [Visual Studio Team Services Extension Project Template](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a00f6cfc-4dbb-4b9a-a1b8-4d24bf46770b)
- HTML, CSS
- Work item form action is written in JavaScript (action.html)
- Task adding logic and summary is written in TypeScript (app.ts)

Slides are in the root of github source repo - "VSTS Extensions.pptx"

####Hope you find this useful!
